# libDayOne

libDayOne is a simple python module that can read/write journal entries from the Day One journaling app.
this was designed mostly for personal use, but feel free to use it in your projects

## usage

right now there is only one class called DayOneEntry which represents a Day One Entry. I will add more functionality as the need arises...

see the `example.py` for simple usage.


##Other projects of note

there are already a few projects out there which deal with Day One journals in various manners; such as

* the excellent command line journaling app [jrnl](http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/)
* wxWidgets based front-end written in python [here](https://github.com/nitinthewiz/pyDayOne).
* other tools and resources on the [DayOne support page](http://dayoneapp.com/tools/)
